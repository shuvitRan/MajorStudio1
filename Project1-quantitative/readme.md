# What Are They Painting?

An insight of Metropolitan Museum of Art's paintings collection. This is a data visualization of the top 10 tags of paintings from 9 countries/civilizations in four periods of time: before 1300 CE, 1300 CE – 1600 CE Renaissance in Europe, 1600 – 1900 covering the Enlightenment, and 1900 to today, the modern era. It gives you a close look at the changes in painting subjects throughout a country’s history and the differences between each country within the same time period. Due to the limitations of the data set, this visualization may not capable of representing the actual cultural differences between countries.
